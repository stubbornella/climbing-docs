<h1>IFSC Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events</h1>
<p>The international federation of sport climbing released its 2025 paraclimbing regulations. The document was a PDF
    that was in accessible to screen readers so I converted it to HTML. It is far from perfect, but should be a lot
    better than the PDF. For some odd reason every bit of text on the PDF was set with every element being offset from
    the bottom by hundreds of pixels. It had no semantic value when I tried to auto convert it. So this was a labor of
    love. My 9yo and I worked on it today. I think they learned a lot about HTML.</p>
<p>The regulations change all the time, this is just a snapshot from March 2025. Please check the latest emails from
    IFSC and USA Climbing.</p>

    <h2 id="combinedclassevents"><span class="secnum">A </span> Annex A - Combined Class Events</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <p><span class="secnum">A1.1 </span> Given the purpose, principles, and rationale behind classification, it follows
        that athletes should be grouped for competition only with athletes from the same Sport Class to ensure fair and
        meaningful competition. This is not always be possible in practice (for example, where there are an insufficient
        number of athletes within a single Sport Class to ensure that an event remains viable). Consequently, in certain
        circumstances, the IFSC may propose to allow athletes with different Sport Classes to compete against each other
        in Combined Class Events.</p>
    <p>The IFSC acknowledges the general principles for Combined Class Events set out by the International Paralympic
        Committee. In particular, the IFSC may propose Combined Class Events to provide opportunity for participation
        competition. However Combined Class Events should not be used where they would create a structural bias between
        the participating athletes.</p>
    <h3><span class="secnum">A2 </span> Principles</h3>
    <p><span class="secnum">A2.1 </span> The IFSC may propose Combined Class Events where a Sport Class does not meet
        the Minimum Registration Requirements of Annex B, and where:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the relevant Sport Classes would normally or typically compete on common routes. The underlying point here
            is not principally the grade or difficulty of the routes, but rather that their design is
            impairment-agnostic.</li>
        <li>all Sport Classes being combined would be invalid in the absence of a Combined Class Event. The purpose here
            being to provide opportunity for participation to athletes who would otherwise lose that opportunity in the
            absence of a Combined Class Event.</li>
        <li>the higher impairment Sport Class being combined would be invalid in the absence of a Combined Class Event.
            The underlying rationale here is to allow athletes who would otherwise be unable to participate the choice
            to 'compete upward' against athletes with reduced impairments.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="secnum" id="secnumA2-2">A2.2 </span> Combined Class Events may not be proposed where:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the relevant Sport Classes have different functional impairments, regardless as to whether the Sport Classes
            typically compete on common routes. e.g. A Combined Class Event grouping athletes with a Visual Impairment
            together with athletes with Range/Power impairments is not permitted.</li>
        <li>only the lower impairment Sport Class would be invalid in the absence of a Combined Class Event. In this
            case, the creation of a Combined Class Event would impose an unnecessary competitive disadvantage on the
            [lower] Sport Class being grouped.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><span class="secnum">A3 </span> Permitted Combined Class Events</h3>

        </li>
        </li>
        <li id="routedesignsafety">[3.2] Wherever possible, the design of the route should make such precautions
            unnecessary, and such precautions must be implemented for all competitors or none. The Jury President will
            not consider requests for added security measures by or on behalf of individual competitors.</li>
        <li id="videodistribution">[4.7] In deciding which video distribution method is appropriate, the Jury President
            must consider the availability of wireless connections and the accessibility of video hosting services.</li>
        <li id="onsight">[4.8] Enforcing strict on-sight regulations in climbing competitions presents challenges in
            outdoor venues. The integrity of individuals and teams, as well as their adherence to a shared ethos is
            fundamental to maintaining the spirit of fair play. Where the competition venue is open to the public or
            overlooked by a public area, competitors may observe routes/boulders from these areas whilst they are open,
            however the following actions are prohibited:
            <ol>
                <li>entering any part of the Competition Area or any other area not open to the public.</li>
                <li>watching, recording, or making use of any recordings of the work of the routesetters.</li>
                <li>using drones or other devices to gain a closer or detailed view not generally available to the<br />
                    public.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="callzone">[4.10] The Jury President will allow a competitor not in the Call Zone at the relevant time to
            climb where their absence is the result of factors outside the control of the competitor.</li>
        <li id="scoringleftrightimpairments">[5.1] The Scoring Topo may allow multiple holds to have the same scoring
            value where left/right route variations have been created to accommodate left/right impairments.</li>
        <li id="scoringtoporelease">[5.1] The Scoring Topo may be distributed internal to the IFSC prior to the closing
            of the warm-up area. The Event Delegate may authorise release of the Scoring Topo to media ahead of this
            time where suitable embargo arrangements are in place.</li>
        <li id="commonactions">[5.2] Actions common to the sport include:
            <ol>
                <li>clipping: i.e. securing a rope into a quickdraw or anchor.</li>
                <li>shaking out: e.g. relaxing one arm while maintaining balance to manage fatigue.</li>
                <li>celebrating: e.g. acknowledging a successful move or ascent.</li>
                <li>chalking up: e.g. applying chalk to hands for improved grip.</li>
                <li>changing foot position: adjusting foot placements for better balance and efficiency.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="pointsdata">[7.2] Points data presented on the Official Results will be presented rounded to 3 decimal
            places.</li>
        <li id="singleroute">[7.2] A competitor who has a result on only one route will be ranked equal last on the
            other route.</li>
        <li id="appealnotice">[9.1] If a verbal notice is given, the Appeal Jury will register the appeal so that
            affected parties are aware that the appeals process has been initiated. The Appeal Jury may begin reviewing
            admissible evidence but must not decide on the merit of the appeal until a written submission is received.
            If a written appeal is not submitted within the required timeframe, the appeal will be recorded as
            unsuccessful (rejected) and an appeal fee charged.</li>
